    <div>
      <p> The Queen's Gambit is the best series ever. It has 6 episodes in total, and each episode is about an hour long. It has the same format as the BBC Sherlock Holmes (you should also watch that), as in each episode is it's own story, but everything links together very nicely. The Queen's Gambit is about this girl, Elizabeth [Beth] Harmon, and she has an ability at chess. The series follows her life from when she joined an orphanage at age 9 to when she competes in a world tournament of chess.</p>
